Description: Functions to manipulate, pre-process and analyze spectra in the mid-infrared region. The pre-processing of the mid-infrared spectra is a transcendental step in the spectral analysis. Preprocessing of the spectra includes smoothing, offset, baseline correction, and normalization,  is performed before the analysis of the spectra and is essential to obtain conclusive results in subsequent quantitative or qualitative analysis.
